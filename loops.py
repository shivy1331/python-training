# there are two types of loops in Python:

# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop

# for loop
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i, end=' ')

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']    
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit, end=" ")

# for i in range
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i, end=" ")

# while loop
# i = 0
# while i < 5:
#     print(i, end=" ")
#     i += 1
